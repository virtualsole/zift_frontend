        <Accordion.Header>What is ZIFT good for?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        Like other stablecoins, ZIFT is good for converting your crypto funds into something stable during times of high volatility. This can help you lock in prices and avoid fluctuations in the market. ZIFT is also commonly used in trading pairs, giving you direct access to many different coins on the market. If you donâ€™t want to move funds off the blockchain, ZIFT can let you store your money on-chain with a lower risk of volatility.
