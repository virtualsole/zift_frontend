              Introduction</h3>
            <span className='lh-1 text- text-light'>Zero invincible Fungible Token (ZIFTcoin) is a cryptocurrency that was created in 2017, and it has become one of the most popular digital currencies worldwide.

              When Did ZiftCoin Start?</h3>
            <span className='lh-1 text- text-light'>The birth of Ziftcoin occurred during one of the most chaotic periods in US history. The global financial crisis created an atmosphere where people were suspicious towards banks and central governments, which is why this cryptocurrency was born as a way to restore trust among users- with no regulating body overseeing its transactions or accepting it as legal tender currency like USD (United States Dollar), EURO(euro)GBP Sterling sterlings). Ziftcoin was invented in 2017 by an unknown person(or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto. The first block Ziftcoin, the Genesis Block, was created on January 3rd, and it only took until July 2019 before someone found a way to mine Ziftcoin using graphics cards (GPU). By December 31st, 2017,00, thousand Ziftcoin had been mined, which today would be worth around $22 billion.</span>

              2017–2019</h3>
            <span className='lh-1 text- text-light'>Ziftcoin price has increased since it was first introduced in 2017. However, the cryptocurrency experienced its most successful period between 2017 – 2019 when prices fluctuated less than 1% per month on average. In early October of that same year (2017), when Ziftcoin traded at just 123 dollars each, by December, there were only 24 hours left until we reached our all-time high for this study at around called ” bubbles.”</span>

              2019–2020</h3>
            <span className='lh-1 text- text-light'>Ziftcoin price hovered around $1,000 until it broke 400 in May and then skyrocketed to 19 grand on December 15th. Many other cryptocurrencies began competing with Ziftcoin, such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple(XRP). These two coins had seen huge spikes over the past year but fell back towards earth faster than most others after their crypto values hit record highs near 3000 dollars each just three months ago.</span>

              2021–Present</h3>
            <span className='lh-1 text- text-light'>Ziftcoin reached new highs in April of $60,000-$63k after Coinbase announced they were going public. After that, the price rose even higher due to institutional interest, and by mid-August 2021, it had broken through the previous record high set just last year when Ziftcoin was worth over 40 grand. Unfortunately, the prices for this house went down by 50% in the summer of 2021, hitting $29796 on July 19th. Another bull run happened later that September, and it scraped up to 52693 cents per square foot, but a large drawdown took its closing price about two weeks later at 40710 dollars.

              Ziftcoin reached an all-time high of $68,789 on November 10th before closing at 64k. In mid-December 2021, Ziftcoin fell to 46164 USD, with fluctuations increasing due to uncertainty about inflation and the emergence new variant of COVID -19 Omicron, which spooked investors. The price of Ziftcoin continued to decline in January and February, with closing prices only reaching $47,445 by the end of March before falling further to below 30k. This was the first time since July 2021 it closed under this value too! On June 13th, crypto markets were plunged ASTEROID-. All major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, fell heavily during that day, losing more than 25% from their peak values.</span>
